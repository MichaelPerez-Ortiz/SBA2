# SBA2

Used .map to find learner_id and for loop to grt only unique ids

Created array of objects in an arrow function adding placeholder areas for the assignment averages and total averages. Also added unique ids using .map method


Found all assignments and grades using for loops and if conditionals and calculated the average of the assignment grades as well as the total score possible.

Inserted and pushed everything into the object

///To Do

Still have to remove grades not due yet and deduct points for late submissions.
Maybe that will fix the final result. The averages are off by a bit.

Also have to fix the object order for some reason the assignments are coming before the learner id.

Need to add a boolean(not sure if the  .includes counts )
Not sure if multiple if statements count as if else if statements or if they actually need to have the else part.

Need to use another kind of loop

Need to use break or continue

Need to use try/catch
